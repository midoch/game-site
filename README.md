# Game Site

## Task

Create a fan site of a game you like. Page to showcase basic HTML, CSS & JS.

## Thoughts

I chose RuneScape as of my Fan site to create because i really liked the game as i grow up. In this project i spent more time, on organize "beginner friendly" clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer.
i have also spent a lot more time on re-design as i followed a Figma design provided by my teacher.
